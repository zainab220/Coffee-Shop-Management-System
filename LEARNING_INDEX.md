## 🎓 Study Tips

### 1. Active Reading
- Don't just read - **code along**
- Open the actual files mentioned
- Run the code and see what happens
- Modify code and observe changes

### 2. Use Multiple Resources
- Read COMPREHENSIVE_LEARNING_GUIDE.md for concepts
- Check ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md for visuals
- Reference QUICK_REFERENCE.md while coding

### 3. Trace Complete Flows
Pick one feature (e.g., "Place Order") and trace it:
- Start from user click
- Follow through frontend code
- See API call
- Follow backend processing
- See database interaction
- Follow response back
- See UI update

### 4. Build Incrementally
- Start with small changes
- Understand each change
- Build up to bigger features

### 5. Ask Questions
- "Why is this done this way?"
- "What happens if I change this?"
- "How does this connect to that?"
